**What V is planning on Doing:** 

#I. Data Pre-processing 

1. randomly select a smaller portion of the data (y'all my computer is a bit old and she be working wayyyy too hard with these large files)

2. We can each randomly select different portions of the data to work on, or we can all agree to work on the same randomly selected portion. Open to thoughts and discussion. 

#II. Data I want to focus on

The IDs 

#III. Things I want to Explore  // Questions I want to answer 

1. Type of classification 

2. Understand what source IPs and source ports are 

3. Explore the source ports 

4. Maybe map source ports to destination ports 

5. Map source IP to destination IP 

6. What is this priority column and visualize the distribution of priorities
